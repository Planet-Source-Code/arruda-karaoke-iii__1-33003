    This Code not is commented... :(

and register with Regsvr32.exe before opening the project.  
  

    Important:
    ==========
    The file "MIDI.DLL" was developed with VB 6.0, and it's  
necessary that the file MSVBVM60.dll be already previously  
registered in its PC.    
  
    This code was not tested fully and still exist some bugs  
that need to be corrected. Unfortunately I don't have time ... :)  
  
    If you have some comment to do, please, write me.
